Side Projects - Repository Description

As I venture into my programming career I enjoy writing scripts that I otherwise wouldn't normally get to write in my current position.

This is both to get practice using functions I'm not used to using and simply to satisfy my quench for coding!

Fair warning: my education is in physics, so many of the programs I'll likely write will draw inspiration from that.
